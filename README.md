# The Bowling ~~Green Massacre~~ Game Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Semantic UI React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React).

A bowling simulation, made as an exercise for a code challenge, to showcase basic principles and thought patterns as a developer. Coding a basic game sounds easy in principle, but the scoring of this game is deceptively complex, with the necessity to look behind and ahead, and manage a variable state, with differing rules based on your current progress in the game.

To play locally:
1. Clone down this repository. 
2. Execute `npm install` or `yarn` in this folder on the command line.
3. Hit the button if it's your turn!

I would love to test this application, and I know just the paces I want to put it through.
